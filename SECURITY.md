# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential security issue in Raito, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately by opening a GitHub issue and checking the `This is a security vulnerability` box,
or by contacting the maintainer directly via GitHub.

## Bug Bounties

We appreciate all responsible reports of security problems, but Raito is a personal open source project —
there is no bug bounty program at this time.

## Vulnerability Disclosures

Critical security issues will be disclosed through GitHub’s
[security advisory system](https://github.com/Aidenable/Raito/security/advisories) after a patch is released.
